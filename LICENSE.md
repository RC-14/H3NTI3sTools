# I consider this my code

Even though this file is called `LICENSE.md` there is no real license in this file.

TLDR; I want to call this mine, you can use it and if I don't have the rights to something you should tell me so I can remove it. (somewhat oversimplified)

## I'm not a lawyer

I'm not a lawyer, my native language isn't english and in this file I'm only trying to express my intentions.
(I'm not sure if that's the right word but you get the idea)

There may be parts where I was not clear enough, didn't understand the language good enough or sommething else.

## Mine, all of it

I consider this my code and if you decide to contribute something to this repo I consider it a gift and that it's now also mine.

This means that you have to check that you don't contribute code to this project that you can not gift to me and that I can do with this repo and all the code inside it whatever I want.

## You can use this code

Don't be scared:
I allow anyone to use all the code in this repo for any purpose without having to mention me or anyone/anything else.
(though it would be nice if you mention this repo)

## Code that I do not have the rights to will be removed if you tell me where it is

This does of course not apply to (for example but not limited to) typescript which is only referenced in this repo and not actually a part of it.

If you find any code in this repo that I do not have the rights to create an issue about it and I'll reomeve with a `No rights to this code.` commit message.

This obviously means that I am do not know of any code in this repo that I do not have the rights to and that all code that was removed with the previously mentioned commit message is not mine and I have no rights to it.

I do not consider code that was removed with the previously mentioned commit message to be a part of this repo though I will remove the commit history as part of removing the code that I do not have the rights to if it is requested.
